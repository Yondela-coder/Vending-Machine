Vending Machine Project DESCRIPTION
=====================================

I have designed and developed a vending machine which vends products based upon four denominations of
coins and returns coins if there is no item.

Objectives:

1. When the application loads, it loads data about all the instances from the products and
   Coins and visualizes this data in some way. (e.g. A table with all the data)
   
2. The application must have some mechanism for refreshing all the data from the API without
   having to reload the entire application (e.g. A refresh data button)
   
3. The application must have some mechanism for refreshing the data of only a section
  (products or coins)
  
4. The application should show the user some indication that it is refreshing/loading new data

 Code:
==========================================================================================================
 
The code can be found in the file called VendingMachine.java

Testing the Vending Machine Solution
======================================
To test the solution, you can open the jar file. 
You can click on the file called WebApp_Interview.jar 
The file will download, then click the downloaded file to open the vending machine. 

=======================================
Check point procedures:
1. Insert money
2. Select Item
3. Select purchase
4. If you don't have enough money it will communicate not enough funds.
5. Refresh by clicking clear
6. If you dont want the purchase anymore you can cancel and machine will return your money.
