Vending Machine Project DESCRIPTION
=====================================

I have designed and developed a vending machine which vends products based upon four denominations of
coins and returns coins if there is no item.

We require you to develop a single page application that does the following:
1. When the application loads, it loads data about all the instances from the products and
   Coins and visualizes this data in some way. (e.g. A table with all the data)
   
2. The application must have some mechanism for refreshing all the data from the API without
   having to reload the entire application (e.g. A refresh data button)
   
3. The application must have some mechanism for refreshing the data of only a section
  (products or coins)
4. The application should show the user some indication that it is refreshing/loading new data

The code can be found in the file called VendingMachine.java

Testing the Vending Machine Solution
======================================
To test the solution, you can open the jar file. You can click on the file called WebApp_Interview.jar. This will open our vending machine
